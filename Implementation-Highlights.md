# Implementation Highlights: Working Frontend + Backend

## Frontend Implementation

### Authentication & State Management
- Implemented JWT authentication with refresh token mechanism in `AuthContext.tsx`
- Created secure context providers with proper dependency handling to prevent infinite loops
- Built custom `useAuth` and `useWallet` hooks for component access to global state

### Wallet Management
- Developed interactive wallet dashboard with portfolio visualization using Recharts
- Created `WalletList` component with dynamic balance updates and wallet selection
- Implemented secure `WalletDetail` view with transaction history and token balances
- Built `SendToken` component with dynamic gas estimation and transaction confirmation

### Token Swapping
- Implemented `Swap` component with token selection, price comparison, and slippage control
- Integrated token approval workflow for ERC-20 tokens with Permit2 support
- Created real-time price quote integration with multiple DEX sources
- Built transaction confirmation modal with gas estimation and execution

### UI/UX Features
- Implemented responsive design for all screen sizes using Tailwind CSS
- Created smooth dark/light mode toggle with theme persistence
- Built custom loading indicators and toast notifications for feedback
- Implemented transition animations for improved UX using CSS animations

## Backend Implementation

### Authentication System
- Implemented secure user registration and login with bcrypt password hashing
- Created JWT generation with proper signing and verification
- Built refresh token rotation system to prevent token reuse
- Implemented JTI tracking for additional security

### Wallet Operations
- Implemented secure wallet generation using Ethers.js with proper entropy
- Created private key encryption using AES-256-GCM with unique keys
- Built token balance retrieval system with multicall for efficiency
- Implemented transaction signing with proper gas estimation

### Key Security
- Developed hybrid encryption approach (AWS KMS with AES fallback)
- Created secure memory vault for temporary key access
- Implemented key rotation capability for enhanced security
- Built secure key path storage to separate keys from user data

### Swap Integration
- Implemented 0x API integration for optimal swap routing
- Created price discovery endpoint for non-binding quotes
- Built swap quote system with slippage protection
- Implemented token approval and Permit2 signature generation

## Integration Points

### Frontend-Backend Communication
- API services in frontend handle all backend communication
- Axios interceptors manage JWT auth headers and token refresh
- Error handling with consistent user feedback
- Proper loading states during async operations

### Blockchain Integration
- All blockchain operations handled by backend for security
- Transaction status monitoring with frontend updates
- Gas estimation with multiple speed options
- Token balance caching for performance

## Security Measures

- Private keys never exposed to frontend
- JWT with proper signing and verification
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Input validation on all routes
